## 2023 – Florida International University (Miami)  
### UniGo – Smart Cities Communication Platform

**Team members:** Cornelis Puchowicz (concept author), Łukasz Pisarczyk, Piotr Jemielita  

**UniGo** is a communication and collaboration platform for Smart Cities, created in response to challenges faced by students when choosing their field of study.  
The system standardizes information about universities, government programs, and scholarships, offering access to real-time data.  

UniGo uses **artificial intelligence (OpenAI)** to normalize data and match study programs to students’ interests.  
It combines educational data standardization, an intelligent matching algorithm, and a user-friendly interface.  

The team’s research (50 respondents) revealed that **80%** of potential users would like to use such a tool, while **60%** consider the current process of searching for study programs complicated.  
The project addresses problems found in existing government platforms (such as *ELA* and *studia.gov.pl*), which suffer from lack of standardization, outdated data, and poor interface design.  

The project was **invited to the finals of the AIS Student Chapter Competition 2023 in Miami (USA)**,  
however, the team was **unable to attend in person** due to conflicting academic schedules.

## 2021 – AIS Student Chapter Leadership Conference (Virtual)  
### Talk-to – Social Inclusion Application

**Team members:** Klara Dargacz (co-founder, business layer and market research), Irina Frolova (visual design, promotional video, technical support), Hubert Kołcz (co-founder, project coordinator and leader, solution architecture and concept)

On April 9-10, 2021, members of AIS Student Chapters from around the world gathered for the first virtual **AIS 2021 Student Chapter Leadership Conference**, organized by Illinois State University. The event brought together 267 participants from 47 universities and 4 countries.

Students from the Faculty of Management at the University of Gdańsk took **2nd place** in the international **Showcase Competition**, creating an application aimed at people with difficulties in making contacts, extremely shy individuals, and those with social phobia.

**Talk-to** addresses the problem of social withdrawal and offers a way to reduce it. The application was designed to meet the needs of people who want to actively participate in social life but, for various reasons, do not have that opportunity.

The team noticed that many people, during severe crises, are afraid to ask for support from their closest ones, while free psychological help is only available after a long waiting period. The problem was deepened by pandemic-related restrictions.

The project, developed since July 2020, consisted of an 8-minute video presentation featuring a staged film illustrating the social problem, as well as a presentation of the initial version of the designed application.

<p align="center">

**Achievements:**
- **2nd place** in the **Showcase Competition** at AIS 2021 Student Chapter Leadership Conference
- Only non-American team awarded in the 2021 AIS Student Chapter Competition
- Qualified for finals from among all submitted projects
- Highest level of competitiveness due to the largest number of participating projects
- 8-minute video presentation showcasing both the problem and solution

The application is currently in the development phase and will be released to the wider public in the near future.

**Project focus:**  
Social Inclusion, Mental Health, Crisis Support, Community Building, Pandemic Response
